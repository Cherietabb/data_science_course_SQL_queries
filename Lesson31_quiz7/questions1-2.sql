-- Here is the necessary quiz to pull the first month/year combo from the orders table.
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at))
FROM orders;

/*
Then to pull the average for each, we could do this all in one query, but for readability, I provided two queries below to perform each separately.
*/
SELECT
  AVG(standard_qty) avg_std,
  AVG(gloss_qty)    avg_gls,
  AVG(poster_qty)   avg_pst
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) =
      (
        SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at))
        FROM orders);
